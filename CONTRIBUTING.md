# How to contribute

 1. Always **rebuild** before committing.  
    Verify the build is successful.

 2. Try to keep the code formatting (2-space indent, etc.).

 3. Make it **readable and structured**. If you feel you're  
    adding too much code on a file, consider adding another.

 4. If you modify the version in `package.json`, update  
    the one in `src/banner.pd`, and viceversa.

 5. (Advanced) Never include full directories, instead  
    create a file with the same name as the directory (but  
    with the suffix `.pd`) and include the files there.
